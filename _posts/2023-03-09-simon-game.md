Simon Game!

In this challenge, I apply my JavaScript, CSS and HTML knowledge to build a pattern game.

Here are the game rules for people who are not familiar with them.

1. Press any key to start the game.

2. Player needs to remember the colour pattern and repeat it by pressing the coloured buttons in the correct order.

3. When you mess it up, press any key to start again.
