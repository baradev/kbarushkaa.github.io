My testing project involved the assessment of the Demo Bank Application. Initially, the documentation provided was poorly written and lacked specificity. I found numerous bugs. However, through effective collaboration with the developers, we were able to improve the application's appearance, enhance the documentation quality, and successfully resolve the bugs. As a result of these efforts, we reached a level of product quality that enabled us to deploy Version 4 of the application.

Project progress step by step: 

1. Reading Software Requirement Specification (SRS)
2. Writing & Executing Unit Test Cases 
4. Writing & Executing Integration Test Cases
5. Bug tracking, JIRA
6. Version 2 of the Application released
7. Retesting failed Unit and Integration Test Cases, updating Bug reports
8. Version 3 of the Application released
9. Retesting failed Unit and Integration Test Cases, updating Bug reports
10. Executing System Test Plan, Bug tracking 
11. Version 4 of the Application released
12. Retesting failed System Test cases 
13. Project is closed, Application came alive
