Simon game!

In this challenge from my software development bootcamp I apply my new knowledge about javascript, css and html to build a patern game.

Here are the rules of the game for people who are not famaliar with it.

1. Press any key to start the game.

2. Player needs to remember the collor patern an repeat it by pressing the colored buttons in the correct order.

3. When you mess up, press any key to star again.
