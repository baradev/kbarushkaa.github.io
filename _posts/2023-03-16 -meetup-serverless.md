Serverless!! 

This meetup was incredibly inspiring. I learned how to build a Serverless Application in AWS. 

Serverless computing enables developers to build and run applications without having to provision or manage servers. Instead, developers concentrate on writing code for individual functions or services, while the infrastructure and scaling are automatically handled by the cloud provider. I also gained a deeper understanding of AWS Lambda and DynamoDB.
