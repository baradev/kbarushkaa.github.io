I am Barbora and I am curently home-based tech student. 

My career is not liear. Back home I used to work as a music teacher. When I moved to New Zealand, I started to learn english, focus on rasing my children. Then pandemic and life circumstances shaped my career path and I realised that I would like to be a part of tech word. Controbute on some project who can help people to live easier better modern life. 

At the begenning, two years ago I started with software developemnt bootcamp. I used every spare stay-at-home-mum minute to learn JavaScript, Css,ddfdfd. 
But I was feeling a little bit lonely on my study journey so I seek for Auckland tech comunities and started to meet people who gave me support, motivation and better wiew of the real life in technology industry. Later on I also finished QA testing course.

In June 2022 I've been part of AWS Hapori Wahine program and the whole new world open to me. I've finished my Cloud Practicioner exam and this was the first spark for my passion for cloud technology. 

For better understanding the lifecycle of companies I study Agile approach and get my AgilePM certificate. 


I love coffee and vegetable and music is still important part of my life and my journey.
