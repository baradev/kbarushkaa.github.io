I used to be a music teacher, but then motherhood came and changed everything!

While focusing on raising my children, I discovered a new passion for coding.  

I master quickly learning new skills, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and NextJS. Iâ€™m also passionate about the cloud and now I am 2x AWS Certified.
