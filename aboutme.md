I am a former teacher who, during motherhood, discovered a love for coding. When the pandemic struck, like many others, my life was deeply impacted. I found myself dedicated full-time to my children, and while I adore them, I couldn't shake off the frustration.

To change my habits and prioritize my mental health and overall fitness, I embarked on a transformative journey. That's when the idea struck meâ€”I wanted to create my own habit tracker not on paper but digital! Then I realised coding became my sanctuary, a time where I could be alone, studying and coding, an almost meditative experience.

Since then, coding has become a daily ritual for me, with the goal of learning something new about programming every day.

And now here I stand, ready to start a new chapter as a software developer.
