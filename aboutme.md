I used to be a music teacher, but then motherhood came and changed everything!

While focusing on raising my children, I discovered a new passion for technology and a desire to keep up to date with them.

I master quickly learning new skills, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and Playwright. I’m also passionate about the cloud. I am AWS cloud certified with a focus on Storage, Database, Management and Governance, and Amazon Connect.

My goal is to join a New Zealand-based company in an entry-level position. I’m eager to contribute to building a strong cloud foundation and leverage the benefits of cutting-edge technology.

If my skills and mindset resonate with you, I would be delighted to get in touch.
