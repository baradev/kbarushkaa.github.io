I am Barbora, and currently, I am a home-based tech student.

My career is not linear. Back home, I used to work as a music teacher. When I moved to New Zealand, I started to learn English, focusing on raising my children.
Then pandemic and life circumstances shaped my career path, and I realised that I would like to be a part of the tech world. I wanted to contribute to some project who can help people to live an easier, better modern life.

Two years ago, I started with a software development boot camp. I used every spare stay-at-home-mum minute to learn new stuff.

With time I was feeling a little bit lonely on my study journey, so I seek for Auckland tech communities and started to meet people who gave me support, motivation and a better view of the real-life in the technology industry. Later on, I also finished the QA testing boot camp.

In June 2022, I've been part of the AWS Hapori Wahine program, and a whole new world opened to me. I've finished my Cloud Practitioner exam, and this was the first spark for my passion for cloud technology.

For a better understanding of the lifecycle of companies, I study the Agile approach and get my AgilePM certificate.

I love coffee and vegetable, and music is still an important part of my life and my journey.
